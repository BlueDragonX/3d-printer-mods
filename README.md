# 3D Printer Mods

This repo contains a collection of models I've designed or modified in order to
improve my 3D printing operations. README's are included with specific mods
where they are not self explanatory or a BOM is required.

Mods for individual printers are kept in [printers](./printers/).

Mods and prints for no specific printer are in [common](./common/).
