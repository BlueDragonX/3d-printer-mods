# Voron 2.4 Mods

Mods for the [Voron 2.4].

## panels/randell_hinge_mod

This is a modification to the [Randell's hinge mod] to allow the use of drop-in nuts instead of hammerhead nuts.

## exhaust/no_exhaust

This mod eliminates the exhaust fan and filter and replaces it with a slimmed down grill and housing. You must implement your own filtering solution! Printing gives off harmful VOCs.
